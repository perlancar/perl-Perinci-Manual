# ABSTRACT: Extra documentation for Perinci

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The C<Perinci> namespace contains several separate frameworks (for example:
L<Perinci::Sub::Wrapper>, L<Perinci::CmdLine>), all themed around the L<Rinci>
and L<Riap> specification, and each framework having its own documentation. This
distribution contains additional, mostly cross-framework documentation.

The documentation is organized around the concept of "four types of
documentation". See L<https://documentation.divio.com/> for more details.
